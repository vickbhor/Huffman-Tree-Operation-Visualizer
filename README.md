# Huffman-Tree-Operation-Visualizer
An educational C++ tool that visualizes Huffman encoding and decoding, with support for both interactive console use and file-based compression via a custom .huff format. This project aims to bridge the gap between algorithm theory and implementation through a clear, modular, and beginner-friendly design.
